# Semantic Segmentation in the context of Autonomous Driving using the Mask R-Convolutiona Neural Network
This repo contains my **thesis**.

The data for training and evaluated were found in kaggle's competition on workshop on autonomous drivng 2018, link below :

This project presents a state-of-the-art instance segmentation Mask RCNN algorithm to train and build models on a very challenging autonomous driving dataset that is captured in the streets of China. An attempt is made to improve the model and the performance is measured after training and finetuning the pretrained model. The experiment results shows that finetuning the Mask RCNN algorithm helps significantly in improving the accuracy of instance segmentation of vehicles and pedestrians. This research is an effort in image segmentation in the context of autonomous driving using Mask R-Convolutional Neural Network.
